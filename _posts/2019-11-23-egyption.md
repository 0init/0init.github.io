# 39yp714n ▲▲▲ is a misc Challenge with 400 points and 0 solved
![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/39yp714n/1.png)

I got a hint after the competition, then I was able to solve it .

## After downloading the challenge you got a defected png called fixed.png 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/39yp714n/2.png)

### try to open it , 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/39yp714n/3.png)

you'll get this, it can't be identified as png.

Before checking it, let's try to look to the metadata by exiftool, maybe we get the flag or get some help. 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/39yp714n/4.png)

we just got a small description of the image and a message telling us the flag is not here . 

### so lets continue with pngcheck .

i really didn't understand what is that error means . 

so i take all the error and searched for it on google . 

I found a write-ups for challenges with the same problem  .

I read one of them and finally I understood what was that mean  .

### the headers that identify the file as png were in the wrong positions with a wrong length for some of them .

### so we have to fix the headers . 

so you can read more about png headers and you can make your own fixing tool , or you can search for a fixing tool as what i did , or you can easily put the png to any photoshop and it'll fix the image . 

i found png header fixer

after fixing the png i got this photo of Giza pyramids as in the description .

### i know what are you thinking about , the flag is the words in the sand . 

but believe me, I spent the last 2 hours in the competition trying to read it, and I couldn't . 

what about the data matrix, lets see what is the hidden data on it?

I used an online tool to check it, and I found a hint. 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/39yp714n/11.png)

## " Hint : How did you fixed me!! " 

then I tried to get any more data from the pixels of the data matrix, but there was nothing more  . 

### Usually any challenge contains a step that contains a change of the source of the file , i do xor to the old source and new one , but i didn't do that here . 

and that was the hint i got after the  completion ," oldcrc ^ newcec " . 

so i managed to try the xor and i used this script : 
```python
new = open("output.png").read()
old = open("fixed.png").read()

newhex = ["{:02x}".format(ord(c)) for c in new ]
oldhex = ["{:02x}".format(ord(c)) for c in old ]

flag =[] 
for i in range (len(newhex)) :
	x =  int(newhex[i], 16)
	y =  int(oldhex[i], 16)
	if ( y^x != 0):
		flag.append(chr(y^x)) 
print ''.join(flag)

```

## and we got the flag .
