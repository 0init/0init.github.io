# Strings is a reverse challenge 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/1.png)

#### After downloading it in a Linux environment, and running file command I got this output

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/2.png)

yup it's PE32 , mmm

you start to think of ida or ghidra, but I think of Olly

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/3.jpg)

but before moving to Olly, the name of the challenge is very interesting, so I tried to run the strings command on it and I got this

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/4.png)

## W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf

very interesting it seems to be the flag, so I tried to submit it, but it wasn't that easy . 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/5.PNG)

time to test the challenge . 

after opening the exit it asked for password part1 then asked for part2 I tried W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf and many passwords in different ways, but it always shows try the message of wrong password . 

now we know the target is to enter the right 2 parts of the password to get the flag.

lets load it to olly . 


I stared to search for the strings that had appeared on the test . 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/6.PNG)

I found the message to the first part, so I put a breakpoint and moved to it .

### thin I put the first part as : "testpass" 

that I followed the code to see what happens to the password.

Nothing interesting happened until this point .

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/7.PNG)

### it adds 3 to "AL" where the first char of my password, which is 't' so it'll become 'w' 


![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/8.PNG)

then the loop continued to add 3 to all "testpass" chars, so it becomes "whvwsdvv" . 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/9.PNG)

#		1 -	so we have to sub 3 to get 		


I expected it will ask for the part 2 after that, but it starts to do another operation on the encoded password  . 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/10.PNG)

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/11.PNG)

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/12.PNG)


### it started to put the encoded pass in reverse order and compare the position with the my plan password chars  . 

### so the password changed from "whvwsdvv" to "vvdswvhw" 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/13.PNG)

#		2 -	 so we have to put the pass in reverse order  
	

Finally the operation on part 1 ended, and asked for the part 2. 

### the fun is about to start . 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/14.PNG)


### Also, I but "testpass" as part2 . 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/15.PNG)

followed the instructions  

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/16.PNG)

### on the opposite of part1 here it sub 3 from the password chars 

#		3 - 	 so you just add 3 to this step 


### so i expected the value of "t" will be "q" , but it changed to "k"

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/17.PNG)

### i got unexpected values for all chars except ' a ' it become ' ^ ' as expected . 

### there was a strange condition comparing the all chars after the encoded one till z with a.... z

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/18.PNG)

### so my expectation to the code was 

	if passchr-3 in a to z or A to Z :
		do the next step of encodeing . 

	else : 
		i really didn't know 

so i tried the password '123abcxyz'  

### I got '123abc' as './0^_`' as it was expected 

###	so in else it keeps the encoded char whit no changes . 


![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/19.PNG)


and i got 'xyz' as 'gfe' 

LOL it become very obvious 

the alphabet is in reverse order, starting from 'e' to 'z+3' .

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/20.png.png)

#		4- 	you have to revise the alphabet after encoding

## or just follow the image above to get to part two


Now the operation on part 2 ended time to know the password . 

back to "testpass" : 

after encoding the parts it content together and compardto the password  . 

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/21.PNG)

# I was right "W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf" was the password. 

## the funny is that, the code doesn't check the length of any part . 

time to decode it. 

write a script to get the two passwords .

this will be the output for decoding all the password "W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf" with both ways .

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/22.png)

### remember: part1 pass is from right to left 

now time to check our solution .

 
![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/23.PNG)

wow, it's right, we got the flag    : EGCTF{a1b2f5bf436b46bb092239d9e0ff86718eaf74cca1bfa6d43ad554000cacb2c7}

but wait, this also is a valid flag : EGCTF{d3de9d031bf1edf83da8ac211c4fe10fb805f6871b0dd49d8489c8fd0a961ab4}

Also, this one is valid             : EGCTF{c7d70dfe682b42a73db335f00f33029e19864be42c16f6b65fd823a66affa8db}

![images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0init/0init.github.io/master/images/strings/25.PNG)

remember the length of any part is not important, what is important is to equal the "W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf" at the end
