	</h1> strigs is is revese challeng  </h1> 

[1.png]

after dowloading it in a linux invronment , and running file command i got this out put 

[2.png]

yup it's PE32 , mmm

you start to think of iad or ghidra , but i think of olly 

[3.png]

but befor moving to the olly , the name of the challeng is very intersting so i tried to run strings command on it and i got thid 

[4.png]

W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf

very intersting it seems to be the flag , so i tried to submit it ,but it wasn't that easy . 

[5.png] 

time to test the challenge . 

after opening the exe it asked for password part1 then asked for part2  i tried W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf and many passwords in deffrant wayes but it alway shows try the message of wrrong message  .

now we know the target is to enter the right 2 parts of the password to get the flag . 

lets load it to olly . 


i stared to search to the strings that had apperd on the test . 

[6.png ] 

i found the message to first part , so i put a breakpoint  jumped to it  

and but the first part as : testpass 

that i follwed the code to see what happens to the password .

no thing intersting happend untill this point .

[7.png] 

it addes 3 to "AL" where the first char of my password ,  which is 't'  so it'll become 'w' 


[8.png]

then the loop continued to add 3 to all "testpass" chars , so it become "whvwsdvv" . 

[9.png]

		1 -	>>>> so we have to sub 3 to get 		<<<<<<<<


i expected it will ask for the part 2 after that , but it start  to do another operation on the encoded password  . 

[10.png] 

[11.png] 

[12.png] 


it started to put the encoded pass in revese order and compare the posstion with the my plan password chars . 

so the passwod changed from "whvwsdvv" to "vvdswvhw" 

[13.png]

		2 -	>>>> so we have to put pass in reverse order   <<<<<<<<
	

finaly the operation on part 1 ended , and asked for the part 2 . 

the fun is about to start . 

[14.png] 


also i but "testpass" as part2 . 

[15.png] 

followed the instructions  

[16.png] 

on the opposite of part1 here it sub 3 from the password chars 

		3 - 	>> so you just add 3 to this step << 


so i expected the value ot "t" will be "q" , but it changed to "k"

[17.png]

i got unexpected values for all chars except ' a ' it become ' ^ ' as expected . 

there were a stange condetion compaering the all chars after the encoeded  one till z with a .... z 

[18.png] 

so my expection to the code was : 

	if passchr-3 in a to z or A to Z :
		do the next step of encodeing . 

	else : 
		i really didn't know 

so i tried password '123abcxyz'  

i got '123abc' as './0^_`' as it was expected 

	so in else it keep the encoded char whit no changes . 


[19.png]


and i got 'xyz' as 'gfe' 

LOL it become very obvious 

the alphabet is in revese order starting from e to z+3

[20.png]

 		4- 	>> you have to revese the alphabet after while encodeing << 

	or just follow the image above to get part to 


know the operation on part 2 ended time to know the password . 

back to "testpass" : 

after encoding the parts it conctinate together and compardto the password . 

[21.png]

i was rigth "W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf" was the password . 

the funny is that ,  the code dosen't check the length of any part . 

time to decode it. 

write a script to get the two passwords .

this will be the output for decoding all the passwoed "W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf" with both ways .

[22.png]

remember : part1 pass is from rigth to left 

now time to check our solution .

 
[23.png]

wow , it's rith , we got the flag  >> EGCTF{a1b2f5bf436b46bb092239d9e0ff86718eaf74cca1bfa6d43ad554000cacb2c7}

but wait this also is a valid falg >> EGCTF{d3de9d031bf1edf83da8ac211c4fe10fb805f6871b0dd49d8489c8fd0a961ab4}

also this one is valid             >> EGCTF{c7d70dfe682b42a73db335f00f33029e19864be42c16f6b65fd823a66affa8db}

[24.png]

[25.png]

remember the lenght of any part is not important , what is important is to equal the "W3lc0m3_2_EG-ctf" at the end
